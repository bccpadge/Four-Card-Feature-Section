## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - I  was struggling with font size on the title and subtitle on the mobile design. Responsive typography works well because you don't have to write more CSS code in a media query. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
